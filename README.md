# pHLAformer
The pHLAformer is an architecture capable of predicting pHLA binding specificity and affinity. It employs a Transformer encoder and incorporates a Cross-attention mechanism to fuse peptide and MHC sequences. Utilizing the fused hidden layer features for prediction, the model generates attention matrices that reveal the crucial amino acid residues contributing to pHLA binding.
